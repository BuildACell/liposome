# Short summaries and links

## Ishikawa et al, FEBS Letters, 2004

Rehydration of an extruded liposome "cake" has been described by Yomo
and collaborators in [Ishikawa et al, FEBS Letters,
2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579304011743),
based on a [previous
paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365999000474).

## [Danelon et al, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed, 2012]

A method for hydration of a lipid film stratified over glass beads has
been described by [Danelon et al, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed,
2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201107123);
similar experiments and be found in an [MDPI Life
paper](http://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/5/1/969).

## Oberholzer et al, Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 1999

Hydration of lipid film stratified inside a vial is a classical
method, described in [Oberholzer et al, Biochem Biophys Res Commun,
1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X99904047)
(the extrusion after hydration method can be skipped).  Additional
work in this direction is descirbed in [Yu et al, J Biosci Bioeng,
2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389172301803224).

## Fujii et al, Nature Protocols, 2014

Yomo and collaborators have used this method in dozens of
publications.  The protocol is available in
[Fujii et al, 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2014.107).
There is also a [JoVE article](https://www.jove.com/video/55282).

## Spencer et al, JoVE, 2013

The Encapsulation of Cell-free Transcription and Translation Machinery in Vesicles for the Construction of Cellular Mimics 
A simple method for the preparation of vesicles , the encapsulation of transcription and translation machinery, and monitoring of protein production.

The video protocol is based on Sunami et al., Synthesis of Functional Proteins Within Liposomes. Methods Mol. Biol. (2010).
