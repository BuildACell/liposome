# List of the common liposome protocols for the encapsulation of TX-TL mix

## Principles
The liposomes protocols for encapsulating TX-TL mixtures are based on two strategies
- hydration of dry lipids
- transformation of lipid-covered water-in-oil (w/o) droplets into liposomes (aka: droplet transfer / emulsion inversion)

The first strategy leads to samples composed only by lipids and the aqueous phase used for hydration. The second one leads to samples which can contain also traces of oil either as oil droplets, either as oil solubilized in the liposome membrane. 

*Note 1*: by "oil" we mean an apolar solvent (generally a hydrocarbon like dodecane or squalene, or a mixture of hydrocarbons, like the "mineral oil")

**Hydration of dry lipids**

We can distringuish three variants:
1. hydration of a dry lipid film stratified inside a vial
2. hydration of a dry lipid film stratified on the surface of glass beads (diam. ca. 1 mm)
3. hydration of freeze-dried liposomes

These three method of liposome preparations follow the same principle: when dry lipids are put in contact with an aqueous solution, liposomes form spontaneously due to lipid self-assembly. The first two methods differ only for the surface where the film is deposited. Glass beads give the opportunity of stratify lipids over a larger surface. At parity of lipid amount, glass beads distribute better the lipids in thinner layers, thus improving the preparation. In the third variant dry lipids are present as partially intact liposomes, or as parts of them.

When liposomes form, there is the same solution inside and outside. However, care is recommended in exchanging the external solvent (e.g., by dilution), as the outer solution should be kept isotonic with the inner one.

**Droplet transfer**

Firstly, lipid-stabilized w/o droplets are formed by simple emulsification of a small amount of aqueous phase in a lipid-containing oil, next the droplets are allowed to pass through a flat oil/water interface, also stabilized by lipids, to acquire the second lipid layer, and form liposomes. 

The method works well if the inner solution (that goes in the liposome lumen) and the outer solution are *isotonic* but have *different densities*. At this aim, sucrose and glucose are added - at the same concentration - to the inner and outer solution, respectively. Inner and outer solutions can have different buffer and different composition (e.g., TX-TL mix inside, PBS outside), provided that the two solutions are isotonic. Osmotic pressure should be measured by an osmometer. If not available, it can be estimated by simple calculations on the number of solute species.

This is a [protocol](https://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/protocols/3815#/related-articles) for the encapsulation of the TX-TL cell-free protein expression system in the liposomes based on the paper by Miyazaki, M, Chiba, M, Ishiwata, S. Preparation of cell-sized water-in-oil droplets for *in vitro* reconstitution of biological processes in cellular compartments. (2015) Nature. DOI: 10.1038/protex.2015.029
The modified version can be found at [OpenWetWare](https://openwetware.org/wiki/Preparation_of_cell-sized_water-in-oil_droplets) The protocol was used by Malin Jonsson, Miroslav Gasparek (summer 2017 interns), and Zoila Jurado (PhD student at Caltech) to express the GFP in the liposomes in the summer of 2017 in the Murray Lab at Caltech.
