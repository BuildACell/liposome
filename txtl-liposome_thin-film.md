## Overview and Materials

This protocol prepares phospholipid films with and without a lissamine
rhodamine membrane dye to be hydrated later to prepare lipid
vesicles.  This procedure works best for studies with bulk small
unilamellar vesicles, but can be used to prepare giant (>1 um)
vesicles (just skip the extrusion step).

### Materials

A. Glass vials (any will do, but we use [2mL Fisherbrand Class B Clear
   Glass Threaded vials: cat #:
   03-339-21A](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/fisherbrand-class-b-clear-glass-threaded-vials-with-closures-packaged-separately-12/p-204738)

B. Glass syringes of various sizes (ex. Hamilton gastight cat #:
   14-815-238, but any will do) for use with lipids and chloroform

C. Phosphate buffered saline 290 mOsm (Sigma, P4417-100TAB)

D. Mini Extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids)

## Method:

Final reaction conditions:

| Reagent | Source | Final working concentration |
| ------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| DOPC    | Avanti 850375C | 2E-5 mols/vial (1 mL of hydration yields 20 mM vesicles)* |
| Rhodamine Lissamine PE | Avanti 810150 C | 0.1 mol % of POPC |
| Cholesterol | Santa Cruz Biotech sc-202539 | 2X molarity of DOPC, if used |

\* For microscopy, lower concentration of vesicles hydrated in low salt solutions yields higher quality vesicles for imaging (recommend you make 125 uM vesicles once hydrated)

### Step 1: Prepare DOPC films (2.5E-4 mols DOPC/vial)

1. Determine the volume and molarity DOPC vesicles you want to create,
   e.g. 1 mL of 20 mM DOPC vesicles = 2E-5 mols of DOPC. The stock of
   DOPC is 25 mg/mL. To make giant, nice looking vesicles, it is best
   to prepare a more dilute sample of vesicles (like 200 uM). For
   small unilamellar vesicles, you can work with much higher
   concentrations of lipids (we can go up to 130 mM for DOPC)

2. Determine the dye and molar % of the dye : DOPC you would like
   ex. for 0.1 mol% rhodamine DHPE :

3. 2.5e-6 moles DOPC×(0.1 moles Rhod Liss PE)/(100 moles
   DOPC)×L/(moles Rhod in stock)=volume Rhod Liss PE stock to add

4. Add 2e-5 mols DOPC and appropriate amount of Rhodamine PE. Transfer
   with a Hamilton (glass) syringe into a glass vial since you are
   working with organic solvents. Cap and vortex briefly to ensure the
   two components are well mixed.

5. Remove cap and allow the chloroform to evaporate away in the hood.

6. Place the vial into a vacuum chamber for > 1 hrs or leave overnight
   in order to remove all residual traces of solvent. *Removal of
   residual chloroform from the lipid film is very important for high
   quality vesicles.*

7. Cap and store vials in freezer until ready to be used and hydrate
   with 1 mL of aqueous hydration buffer when you are ready to prepare
   vesicles.

### Step 2: Hydrate films and extrude vesicles

1. Add 1 mL of PBS to each vial, place in 60 degC oven for 1 hr, then
   vortex 10 seconds. Lipids should easily assemble. If clumps or
   aggregates persist after several vortexing attempts, this is often
   a sign something went wrong in vesicle assembly. The heating step
   is not necessary and can be excluded, but helps when other membrane
   components are involved like diblock copolymers.

2. Extrude films at room temperature through 100 nm polycarbonate
   membranes using a mini extruder and heating block described on the
   [Avanti
   website](https://avantilipids.com/divisions/equipment-products/mini-extruder-assembly-instructions)
   follow the procedure described
   [here](https://avantilipids.com/divisions/equipment-products/mini-extruder-extrusion-technique)
   (7 passes through membrane is fine, 9-11 is better, more than that
   is unnecessary according to my post extrusion analysis of vesicle
   size distribution on DLS.) Always perform an odd number of passes
   through the membrane so no vesicles that have never passed through
   the membrane end up in the final sample.

### Step 3: Purify vesicles if hydration buffer contained a dye or solute (ex. calcein)

1. Set up columns containing 6 mLs of Sepharose 4B (size exclusion
   column media). Purification should be conducted on the same day as
   a subsequent assay.
