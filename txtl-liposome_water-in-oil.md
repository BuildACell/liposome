## Overview and Materials

This protocol describes how to create liposomes that contain TX-TL
inside of a lipid-based container. The liposomes created by these
protocols are between 1 and 10 um in diameter and should be usable
with an cell-free protein expression system.

The preparation of liposomes using w/o emulsions as template requires
four steps:

### Step 0: Deposition of a thin lipid film in a glass vial

#### Materials:

* Glass vials (any will do, but we use [2mL Fisherbrand Class B Clear
  Glass Threaded vials: cat #:

## Step 0: Deposition of a thin lipid film in a glass vials

The first step in the protocol is to generate the lipid film required
to to form the lipid-in-mineral oil solution. Makes 6 samples with
accurate measurement. Each vial will have ~ 15 mg of lipid with 0.1
mol % of 18:1 Lyss-Rho-PE.

1. Create lipid master mix in a glass beaker.  One of two methods may be used:

    * POPC/Lyss-Rhod-PE 

        a. Add  4 mL (100 mg) of POPC in chloroform (25 mg/ml) 

        b. Add 200 uL (0.2 mg) of Lyss-Rho-PE in chloroform (1 mg/mL) 

        c. Swirl gently until all POPC is dissolved and color is homogeneous.

    * POPC/Cholesterol/Lyss-Rhod-PE 

        a. Add 2.668 mL (66.7 mg) of POPC in chloroform (25 mg/ml) 

        b. Add 1.332 mL (33.3 mg) of Cholesterol in chloroform (25 mg/ml) 

        c. Add 200 uL (0.2 mg) of Lyss-Rho-PE in chloroform (1 mg/mL) 

        d. Swirl gently until all POPC is dissolved and color is homogeneous.

2. Aliquot 700 uL of POPC/Cholesterol/Lyss-Rhod-PE Chloroform solution
into 2 mL glass vials (6 vials total)

3. Place uncapped vials in fume hood, loosely covered with aluminum
foil and allow to evacuate overnight in fume hood (~6-8 hours).

    * **Note:** The purpose of the aluminum foil cover is to protect
      particles from contaminating the POPC/Cholesterol/Lyss-Rhod-PE
      as it evaporates.

4. Move vials to vacuum chamber and vacuum for an additional 2 hours.

5. Store in -20 degC.

**Note:** Remaining POPC in chloroform, cholesterol, and  Lyss-Rho-PE in chloroform can be stored at -20 degC in the glass vial with PTFE caps and sealed parafilm.

## Step 1: Preparation of the oil containing lipids

1. Mix mineral oil by gentle inversion before use 

2. Place 0.5 mL of mineral oil into each of the vials.

3. Incubate at 60 degC  for 10 min

4. Vortex for 10 mins

5. Incubate vials for 3 hrs at 60 degC.

6. Wrap up the top of the vials with aluminum foil and seal with parafilm.

7. Sonicate in an heated water bath for 30 minutes,at 60 degC .

    a. **Note:** If a sonicator is unavailable then repeat 60 degC
    incubation and vortexing until the lipid is completely dissolved.

## Step 2: Self-assembly of the Liposomes by centrifugation

1. Place 225 uL of centrifuge buffer (100 mM HEPES + 200 mM glucose,
   pH 8) into a labeled eppendorf tube.

    a. **Note**: When TX-TL systems are used, the outer solution should
    also contain the small molecular weight components of the TX-TL
    system.

2. Add in 30 uL of inner solution (100 mM HEPES, 200 mM sucrose pH 8,
   and, if needed, 2 uM of a water-soluble fluorescent dye like HPTS
   or calcein.) to 500 uL of suspended lipid in oil from Step
   1. Vortex for 30 s. Equilibrate for 10 min at 4 degC.

    * **Note**: When TX-TL systems are used, buffer is omitted. TX-TL
    systems come with their own buffers.

3. Add the emulsion on top of the 225 uL centrifuge buffer by
pipetting against the wall of the tube, wait at least 1 minute for the
interface to stabilize and flatten between the emulsion and buffer

4. Centrifuge at 18000 rcf at 4 degC  for 15 min  

    * **Note:** If the top phase (oil) is clear, that suggests that
      droplets have passed into the bottom buffer, becoming vesicles.

5. Carefully remove as much mineral oil as possible with a
   gel-loading-pipette-tip from the top.

    * **Note: **The goal is to remove as much oil up to the interface
    without disturbing the buffer below.

6. Place 225 uL of wash buffer (100 mM HEPES + 250 mM glucose, pH 8)
   into a labeled eppendorf tube.

7. Add the centrifuge buffer (where the vesicles should have formed)
   to eppendorf tubes with wash buffer. Make sure to use a new tip to
   avoid contamination.

    * **Note:** An alternative method is to open the eppendorf tube
    and use a 21-gauge needle to punch a hole at the bottom of the
    eppendorf tube. Remove the needle and the close the lid to allow
    the buffer solution to drip out.

8. Centrifuge at 12000 rcf at 4 degC  for 5 min

9. Transfer 225 uL from the bottom of the eppendorf tubes with wash
   buffer into a new labeled eppendorf tube.

## Step 3: Microscopy Visualization

1. Use Frameseal or Spacer (20 mm D x 0.12 mm depth) to make a small
   chamber on a microscope slide.

2. Add 10 uL of the final solution to the chamber and seal with cover slip

3. Wait 5 minutes before imaging (since the liposomes will float
   everywhere and can be tricky to catch them).

4. Observe on an inverted microscope. [Sample images] of what you should see:

### Alternative method (neha): 

* Use a glass bottom chamber:
  [https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/154453](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/154453)

* Block glass by adding 0.5 mL of a 1mg/mL BSA in PBS solution for 10
  minutes (alternatively block by adding 0.5 mL o[f
  SuperBlock](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/37515)
  for 5 min). The blocking step is important because phospholipid
  vesicles will rupture to some degree on glass.

* Rinse with PBS 3X. Add 0.5 mL of final buffer from above to
  chamber. Add 10 uL of vesicle sample to chamber, let settle over a
  few minutes. Image on scope with green and red channels.
