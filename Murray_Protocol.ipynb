    "# Vesicle Protocol: Mixing it up\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "Based on our conversation we had in the Build-A-Cell talk we, Bruce and I, decided to mix it up. We re-did the lipid prep protocol to include vacuum and desiccator, still with the added precaution not to use any plastic (everything was done by weights). The following protocol is a mixture of Vincent's Protocol from the Wiki page and Kate's Protocol. "
