# TX-TL Liposome Protocol

This protocol describes how to create liposomes that contain TX-TL
inside of a lipd-based container.  The liposomes created by this
protocols are between 1 and 10 um in diameter and should be usable
with an cell-free protein expression system.

## Step 1: Liposome-oil emulsion

1. Mix mineral oil by gentle inversion before use (Mineral oil can
   dissolve lipid better than paraffin)
2. Place 0.5 mL of mineral oil in the vials
3. Vortex for 10 mins
4. Incubate vials at 50C for 10mins
5. Repeat 50C incubation and vortexing until the lipid is completely
   dissolved.

### Notes:

* After 3 rounds of this I put the vials to incubate at 60C for 3.5
  hours then vortexed it, the mixture looks a little different than
  before. The consistency looked soft.

* 28 March 2018: What helps in later trials was leaving it in heated @
  60C sonicator bath for 1 hr.

## Step 2: Making liposomes

6. Place 20 μL of centrifuge buffer (PBS + 300 mM sucrose, pH 8) into
   a labeled eppendorf tube

7. Add 2 μL of reaction into 300 μL phospholipid solution, vortex for
   30 s to create an emulsion

8. Add the emulsion on top of the 20 μL centrifuge buffer, wait for the interface to stabilize and flatten between the emulsion and buffer

9. Centrifuge at 11000 RPM for 30 s (tabletop centrifuge works well)

10. Carefully remove the mineral oil, take 10 μL of the centrifuge
    buffer (where the vesicles have been formed)

11. Add 10 μL of solution (where vesicles hopefully \"live\") to 10 μL
    of final buffer (50 mM HEPES + 300 mM sucrose, pH 8), careful not
    to touch the sides of tube

12. Mix gently, pipetting up and down with a new tip"

## Step 3: Microscopy 
13. Use Frameseal to make a small chamber on a coverslip

14. Add 10 μL of the final solution to the inside chamber and seal
    with cover slip

15. Observe on microscope
